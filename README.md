# Auto-Splitter-Scripts
Some auto splitter scripts I made.

## LUA Scripts

### *Installation*

**Prerequisites**: 
- Emulator Bizhawk
- LiveSplit 2.7+

Open EmuHawk.exe, then go to the `Tools` tab and open the `Lua Console` in order to insert the `LUA` script.

Once you have the `LUA Console` opened, go to `Script` -> `Open script` and select the `.lua` file you want.

Don't forget to keep the `LUA Console` tab opened to let the script active!
